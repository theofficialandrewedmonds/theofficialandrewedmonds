- 👋 Hi, I’m @theofficialandrewedmonds
- 👀 I’m interested in software design and engineering, website design, app development.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning react, react-native, flutter
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything, really. I'm not any good at UI/UX design, so learning how to work with a designer on a project would be awesome
- 📫 How to reach me: message me on Instagram @andrewlikesprogramming
